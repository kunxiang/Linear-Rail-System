# Open Source Linear Rail System

## Project Overview

This  project is designed to provide a versatile, modular, and affordable solution for enthusiasts and professionals to build their own linear motion systems. Primarily using 3D-printed parts and standard 2020 aluminum extrusions, our linear rail system is perfect for applications in 3D printers, laser engravers, lightweight CNC machines, and more. Additionally, this system includes a special servo version designed specifically for integration with the popular SO-ARM100 robotic arm, adding an extra axis of motion and expanding the capabilities of this already versatile tool.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Our system is designed to be easily expandable and customizable to fit various lengths and configurations.
- **3D Printed Components**: Most structural components can be produced with any standard 3D printer, making the system accessible and customizable.
- **Standard 2020 Aluminum Extrusions**: Utilizes readily available materials that are both sturdy and cost-effective.
- **Compatibility with NEMA 17 Stepper Motors**: Ensures that the system can be driven with widely used and reliable stepper motors.
- **Integration with SO-ARM100 Robotic Arm**: Enhances robotic projects by seamlessly integrating with the SO-ARM100 to add additional axes for improved functionality.
